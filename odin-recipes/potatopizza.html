    <h1>Potato Pizza</h1>
    <p>This recipe was born on a night when I hadn't gone grocery shopping, didn't have any tomato sauce or traditional pizza fixins on hand, but I did have a bag of potatoes that needed using. It has become a staple for us since that night (who doesn't love carbs on carbs!?) and has gone through dozens of iterations (with or without meat or fish, adding caramelized onions or roasted garlic as an extra layer, swapping in different types of cheese or omitting the cheese), all of which have been a hit. Because it's so simple, there are tons of things you can add to the mix and have it taste great, but you truly don't need anything other than the potatoes, herbs, and pizza dough. Anything else is just a bonus!</p>
